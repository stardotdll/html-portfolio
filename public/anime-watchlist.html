<h3>Shangri-La Frontier</h3>
<p>Wonderful fresh VRMMO Isekai with a great depicition of gamer characters.</p>
<h3>Fieren: Journey Beyond</h3>
<p>
  A wholesome almost slice of life fantasy that dives deep into the
  interpretation of time and our relationship to it.
</p>
<h3>Shield Hero Season 3</h3>
<p>Just the best Isekai for a fun relax time with Naofumi and his harem.</p>
<h3>The Great Pretender</h3>
<p>
  I love heist films like Ocean's 11 and this gives me the same vibe but in
  anime form.
